// my input is basically a whole ass line of code where 
// there will be L/R
// then there will be an accompanying number which represents the magnitude

// first, we need to be able to split it into single instructions
// then my function should be able to process said instructions

// function should take in the instruction, 
// check the direction that it needs to shift by
// shift the dial by said amount,
// check if the dial is pointing the absolute 0
// increment 1 each time its at the absolute 0
function shiftDial(string:string) {
